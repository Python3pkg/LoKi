History
-------

This model uses a Galactocentric cylindrical approach to modeling stellar 
counts and kinematics based off measured luminosity functions and kinematic
distributions. Every parameter in this model is based off probability 
distributions, hence, each run will be different, even for the same input
parameters (thatâ€™s the Loki aspect).


Project Status
--------------

Currently building `Travis <https://docs.travis-ci.com/>`_ implementation.
